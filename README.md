Kung Fu with kinect
======================

Practise a little of Kunf Fu with Kinect.

Compilation
-----------

Load the project in Visual Studio and compile it.
Place the images "done.png" and "hold.png" in `C::\`, otherwise, they won't load.

Use
---------

Click on the button of the pose you want to archieve and try to match the pose. Once the skeleton is green, hold on 5 seconds.

How it works
-------------

The program gets the x,y position of a given skeleton and saves it to the disk. To get the error, we simply obtain the difference between the user tracked points and the saved skeleton.

How can you use it
-------------------

Get a Kunf Fu Master or just someone who tells you if any position you want to practise is correctly done and push the save button. You can rename it and use it again later, change the holding time, and the difficulty inside the program.
